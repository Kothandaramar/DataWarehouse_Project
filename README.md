# DataWarehouse_Project
This project involves designing and implementing a scalable data warehouse using MySQL as the primary RDBMS. The goal is to consolidate data from multiple operational sources into a centralized repository optimized for reporting, analytics, and business intelligence (BI) applications , Machine Learning Application.

### The project follows standard ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes:

- **Extract: Data is sourced from structured operational databases (e.g., transactional systems, logs, Excel files).
- **Transform: Data cleansing, normalization, and schema transformations are performed to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- **Load: Processed data is loaded into dimension and fact tables designed using star schema models.

## Key Features:

- **Import data from source systems.
-  **Clean and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis
-  **Combine the sources into a single source , user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries
- **Focus on the latest dataset only, historization of data is not required.
- **Use of MySQL stored procedures and scheduled jobs for ETL automation.
- **Provide clear documentation of the data model to support the business.


## Tools & Technologies:
- **MySQL 8.x
- **MySQL Workbench
- **Draw.io
- ** Notion
